# Capstone1
Presentation application for research on sentiment and Bitcoin price.

This is a copy of the RShiny app code and data files for the final presentation of a group Capstone project for the completion of our M. Sci. Data Science & Analytics.
The purpose of the project was to determine what relationship there was between the daily price movement of Bitcoin and sentiment of submissions on the Bitcoin 
Subreddit threads.

Overall we found that no predictiblity was available by using the Subreddit sentiment or volume of posts due to the Subreddit posts having a property of being a 
trailing variable.  Interestingly, but most likely insignificant, the highest correlation between prices and sentiment was at +180 days from price movement.

A working example of this code can be found at  https://gtinsley73.shinyapps.io/capstone-presentation/.
